<li>Make sure that you have the proper version installed (<a href="/171">Download Soldat 1.7.1</a>).</li>

<li>Don't ever add for someone else and don't share IP's of game servers.</li>
<li>Enable "Automatically take screenshots of final game score" in Soldat's config.exe and be sure to record demos for each match played. If you fail providing screenshots or demos two times when admins demand them, you'll get banned.</li>

<li>Hacking or cheating of any sort is forbidden and will also result in a permanent ban.</li>
<li>Don't fakenick as other players and don't wear tags of clans in which you don't play.</li>
<li>Alpha Team picks the first map, Bravo team picks the second map. If one of both maps was either a tie or if both teams have each won a map, there will be a tiebreaker map (tb) to determine the winner. You don't have to play a 4th. map (ttb).</li>
<li>Tiebreaker maps are being randomized and you will have to play the tb unless all players agree to play another map.</li>
<li>Teams are being randomized and you are supposed to play in the given teams unless all players agree on switching.</li>
<li>Players are expected to maintain a minimum level of seriousness in their attitude toward competition. Extensively throwing and/or trolling is forbidden.</li>
<li>Playing with certain risky weapons such as Barret or M79 may be punished if it harms your teams performance.</li>
<li>Make sure to provide your team with info either by using taunts or the radio-chat. Spamming taunts or using ASCII art is not allowed.</li>
<li>Pausing is only allowed in urgent situations (disconnects and similar incidents). Pausing for incoming phone calls or similar reasons may be punished.</li>
<li>Unlike in the past, sub calls are only allowed if a player is missing. Calling a sub for yourself is no longer allowed. If you can't play a full gather, don't add.</li>
<li>Stay until the very end of the match. You are not allowed to leave before either the time limit or the cap limit was reached.</li>
