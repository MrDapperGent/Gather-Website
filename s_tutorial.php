<p><center> <img src="http://i.imgur.com/gPGwIxY.png" alt="Screenshot1"></center></p>

<h2>About the Gamemode:</h2>
<p>This game-mode consists of two teams: Alpha (Red) & Bravo (Blue). The goal is for each team to steal the enemy's flag and bring it to your own flag. The team with more captures (caps) in the round are the winners.</p>
<p>There are 32 default CTF maps in Soldat, as well as hundreds of custom made maps.</p>
You should know each default map to succeed in competitive matches. You can get basic map knowledge
 by playing on CTF public servers.</p><p>Tip: You can test the maps offline in singleplayer mode (with no players) to explore map details.</p>
<p>Not all of the default maps are picked frequently in competetive matches.</p>
<p>The most favorized and popular maps for competetive CTF matches are: ctf_Guardian, ctf_Rotten, ctf_Wretch & ctf_IceBeam.</p> <p>The maps above are very popular due to its fast paced gameplay and its perfect layout for 3 vs. 3 matches.
 You will gain advanced map knowledge by playing them frequently in gathers or clanwars.</p>

<div class="content">
<p>This tutorial is directed towards both new and experienced Soldat players.</p>
<p>• The skill-level in gather is relatively high compared to the one in public servers.
<p>Meaning there’s a learning curve for newer players in most cases.
It takes some time until one wraps his head around all these concepts and tactics and is able to perform all of them in-game.
But don't be discouraged or fearful to play! This tutorial can help any new player in creating fast progress, game-sense wise.</p>
<p>• Playing gathers actively will rapidly turn you into a stronger player and you will have the chance to meet the best Soldat players and become a part of the competitive Soldat community.</p>

<h2><a id="Movement"></a>Movement</h2>
</div> <!-- /blue -->
<div class="content">
<p>Soldat has evolved in the past years and movement became a very important factor and the key to succeed. You will gain a lot of advantages if you learn the tricks below. They allow you to move very fast and precise. You can also dodge bullets.</p>
<p>To the contrary of how the movement system in most modern games work, Soldat has a very unique and complex movement system.</p>
<p>Similar to games like Quake you can find players doing a lot of movement-related tricks in Soldat (bunnyhopping, boosting & more).</p>

<p><u><center>The Kickjump:</p></u></center> You will use this whenever you want to go up a 'hill' fast.
<p>What you want to do is run up the hill, while (mashing) the jump button. I say (mashing) because there is an optimal rhythm,
 you don’t want to tap it too fast, you will have to practice to find the best time to spend with jump depressed and jump undepressed (better word?),
 but don’t go counting, even if you can count tenths of a second, just practice and you should get a feel for it over time. At the top of the hill press and hold jump without a direction.</p>
This is what it should look like:
<p><center><img src="http://i225.photobucket.com/albums/dd230/chutem/kickjump-jump.gif" alt="Gif1"></center></p>
 
<p><u><center>Reverse Backflip:</p></u></center> The reverse backflip is similar to the basic backflip.
This time you <li>start facing the same direction you are going</li> <li>while holding a direction button, press jump</li>
<li>then quickly change the direction button and right click</li> <li>All this time you must HOLD the jump button, which is key to most backflips as you will learn.</li></p>
<p><center><img src="http://i225.photobucket.com/albums/dd230/chutem/reverse-backflip.gif" alt="Gif1"></center></p>
<i>Useful for changing direction in certain situations.</i>

<p><u><center>Superman:</p></u></center> Superman allows you to get good lateral movement in mid air, it is better than standing and holding a direction key.
<p>Superman is very easy, just lie down and start jetting, if your jets run out in mid air, you want to stand up and hold a direction key, as it is better than letting your jets load and then jetting again.</p>
<p><center><img src="http://i225.photobucket.com/albums/dd230/chutem/superman.gif" alt="Gif1"></p>
<p>Superman can be effective after a kickjump, but not if you do a regular jump. This means doing a jump to the side and supermanning is the best.</p>
<p><center><img src="http://i225.photobucket.com/albums/dd230/chutem/kickjump-superman.gif" alt="Gif1"></center></p>


<p><u><center>Canonball:</p></u></center>
<p>The cannonball is the best single jump that will get you moving fast, quickly. It can also be a pain to learn and master,
 and also describe. But if you are to learn anything, this would be the best thing to learn. FUN FACT: Some people call the cannonball simply cball, for ease of typing.</p>
<li>First you must press a movement button and look in the opposite direction</li> <li>next you must tap jump and straight after tapping jump</li>
<li>you must right click</li>
<p>Be careful to not overlap the tapping of jump and the click. You should get this:</p>
<p><center><img src="http://imgur.com/SRjfI.gif" alt="Gif1"></center></p>
<i>The cannonball is very good for moving fast over relatively flat areas, by stringing them together.</i>

<p><center><img src="http://i225.photobucket.com/albums/dd230/chutem/kickjump-cannonball.gif" alt="Gif1"></p>
<i>The cannonball is also very good to use at the climax of a kickjump.</i>

<p><center><img src="http://i225.photobucket.com/albums/dd230/chutem/kickjump-cannonball-superman.gif" alt="Gif1"></center></p>
<i>Because the cannonball is very fast and flat, you can superman after a cannonball, and for maximum effect do a kickjump before the cannonball.</i>

<h2><a id="Aiming"></a>Weapons</h2>
</div> <!-- /blue -->
<div class="content">
<p>Soldat doesn't have classes or a buy system to determine which weapon you can choose from. You can select from all available weapons without limitation.
 You can change your weapons whenever you respawn. Press 'TAB' to enable or disable the weapons menu.</p>
<p>That does also mean that weapons in Soldat are fairly balanced. However, it is recommended to adjust your weapon choice depending on the map you play on.</p>
<p>Playing the Barret Sniper on fast-paced maps like ctf_Wretch can't be considered as a good pick while it's a good choice on larger maps such as ctf_Nuubia or ctf_Mayapan.</p>
<p>There is a variety of primary & secondary weapons that you can choose from in Soldat. You can switch to your secondary weapon by pressing 'Q'.</p> Tip: You can also equip 2 primary weapons (e.g AK74 & Barret Sniper).
 To carry 2 primary weapons simply drop your secondary weapon and pick up a weapon from the ground.</p>
 <p><i>We are currently testing the new weapons mod for the upcoming Soldat version 1.7.2</i>. <p>It has a few changes compared to old version such as:</p> 
 <li>reduced overall damage</li>
 <li>improved balancing</li>
 <li>remade AK-74</li>
 <li>remade Minigun</li>
 <li>& others</li>
 <p>You can view the new weapons mod <a href="http://gather.soldat.pl/172/beta9/weapons.ini">here</a> or test it in #gather on our <a href="http://gather.soldat.pl/discord/">Discord server</a>.</p>

<h2><a id="Roles"></a>Personal Gamestyle Roles</h2>
</div> <!-- /blue -->
<div class="content">
<p>• <b>Rusher:</b> The rusher of the team will usually dive straight into the enemy's base in attempt to snatch their flag and score for the team,
 sometimes even completely ignoring enemies just in order to get that capture. However, it might be considerably smarter to try eliminate enemies whilst
 still trying to maintain speed on the rush to the flag. Note also that sometimes your teammates will need cover for potential enemy leaks. So keep your
 eyes on your base with peripheral vision even if your role is to rush. Rush can be done pretty much with any weapon. However there's the M79 and Spas
 which their boosting feature allow faster movement across the maps.</p>

<p>• <b>Defender:</b> The defender of the team will make sure to eliminate any enemies that his teammates failed to killed (leak).
 A defender position is needed in most maps. That being said, it is not highly recommended to play super defensive bunker style for 10
 minutes every map, because a lot of those small maps which are played are about applying constant pressure. If you're the defender of
 the team, try to find a balance and develop a sense of when can you attack and when you must defend. Defenders usually play automatic weapons,
 because the clip-sizes allow them to eliminate multiple enemies.</p>

<p>• <b>All Rounder:</b> Basically a combination of a rusher and defender.
 Such a player can provide the deathmatch when needed, and use momentum to his advantage in order to steal a cap.</p>

<p>Within time you'll realize what style suits you more, however being flexible and prone to the situational changes is probably the best thing you can do.</p>

<h2><a id="Tasks"></a>Tasks</h2>
</div> <!-- /blue -->
<div class="content">
<p>Don't expect that 'capturing the flag' is your only task in CTF. While your main goal is to capture the enemies flag and bring it to yours, you are also supposed to defend your teams base and its flag!</p>
<p>CTF lives from tactis and smart plays. It's important to actually think and play as a team!</p>
<p>If one team has a lead in score they should adjust their playstyle towards being much more defensive and to let the time elapse.</p>

<h2><a id="Mistakes"></a>Known Mistakes</h2>
</div> <!-- /blue -->
<div class="content">
<p>1) Old Dog, New Tricks - Do not be afraid to learn something new (this one is dedicated to all the oldies out there).
 Yes, some of us having been playing over a decade now, but it doesn’t mean that we’re always open-minded. Playing 15 years
 doesn’t negate the fact that there might be something you missed, or something that you haven’t developed enough. Whether
 it’s movement, aiming, game-sense or whichever other aspect comes to mind. Try to keep an open-mind, and use losing, and
 observing the enemies’ actions, as a learning process. If you’ll do that you’ll be able to enjoy the game more, and get better at it as well. Double profit.</p>

<p>2) Leaking - Leaking can mean you completely missed an enemy due to not scanning the areas whilst on the go towards enemy base.
 It can also mean that you've failed a 1vs1 and failed to communicate it out to your team with taunts, so they can try to cover the route. </p>

<p>A good way to avoid leaks is to try to keep peripheral vision and active awareness of your surroundings. If you're sure an enemy is not approaching,
drag your crosshair around the corners of the map to see those blind spots and make sure you haven't missed an enemy (even if your teammates did not
acknowledge you in team-chat). Also in every 1vs1 that you fail, use the respective taunt to hint your team-mates which path to cover.</p>

<p>3) Ignoring Info - Team chat, Taunts and Radio Menu (for Radio use [V] button) are there for a reason. It's extremely important to keep communicating
 with the team during the match.</p>

<p>Soldat has key-bindings (taunts) to send team-chat-messages in a fast way. This allows you to give your team the needed information such as where the
 “EFC” (Enemy Flag Carrier) or the “FFC” (Friendly Flag Carrier) are located. You can assign those 'taunts' to ALT + [1,2,3...A,B,C...]. Get the Soldat Taunt
 Editor tool to create or customize taunts.</p>

<p>Make sure to use the information your team provides in order to enhance teamplay. Also make sure to deliver the CORRECT info to your team.
 If you mistakenly deliver 2 locations of enemy flag carrier, it might confuse your teammates and at times even harm the team's performance.</p>

<p>4) “Doubling” a route or not manning your route - As mentioned above, the roles are a general guideline, to keep
 an understanding between the teammates, who does what in the match. In most cases, not manning your route might force
 your teammates to clean up after your “leak” and generally might cause a lack of flow due to them having to pursue other
 roles. It’s a very risky move and a player should be a hundred percent sure that’s the right time or situation for doubling, meaning
 that the route is either completely clear or there’s a teammate covering using that path for that specific round for you.</p>

<p>5) No focus on base - In many situations it is highly important to clear the base first, for example: in IceBeam, there's
 a potential for multiple caps in a short time due to the skeleton of the map). Make sure to clear the base unless you're in
 a position that forces you to rush out of there, or you see that your teammates are defusing the situation. If you're not sure
 they're handling it (you see they're very Low HP), stick around until the situation is dealt with.</p>

<p>6) Points greediness - It’s a common misconception in CTF to think that you can make up for your lack of performance
of the capturing aspect of the game with a good kills and death score statistics. However, remember that, in the end of the map,
the score team’s flags is the one that matters. Be mindful to your surroundings, cover your teammates in a way that’ll contribute 
to the match and not only your personal stats.</p>

<p>6) Use your weapons - Use your secondary weapon and your grenades! Each player is equipped with a secondary weapons (USSOCOM, Combat Knife, Chainsaw & M72 LAW).
 Each weapon is unique and can be used for different scenarios. You can switch to your secondary weapon by pressing [Q].</p>

<p>- The USSOCOM pistol is usually equipped with one-shot weapons (M79, Barrett).</p>

<p>- The Combat Knife is probably the most common secondary weapon, it can be thrown, very useful for spawn killing or instant-knife-kill upon respawn to prevent enemies from capturing the flag. 

<p>- The Chainsaw is perhaps the hardest secondary to use. Both for novice and experienced shooters, and especially against experienced players.
 You will need a good concept of movement to use it to your advantage.</p>

<p>- M72 LAW very good for defensive scenarios, lurking and spawn killing. You can aim to common spots and "blind shot" or use known ricochet spots to get those blind shots as well.
 It is sometimes used even is a preventive weapon in a way, for example: you get the flag in ctf_Dropdown and players are respawning and you push them back into spawn by 
hitting the poly near them. Then escape with the flag or throw flag to teammate.</p>

<p>- Frag grenades: Default respawn grants 1 grenade, and grenade kits grant a maximum of 3 grenades. Using grenades whilst shooting the enemy can provide a very quick kill with
 a minimal usage of bullets. It is a very effective and commonly used method. Another thing you can use grenades for is boosting on colliders to gain speed (probably should practise
 that as well outside of gather to prevent losing an excessive amount of health due to boosting fails).</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>It might seem a lot of work, but once you get used to each on of these concepts. It can pretty much become autopilot-mode, and you’ll use these good habits without thinking twice.</p>

<h2><a id="Hints"></a>Hints</h2>
</div> <!-- /blue -->
<div class="content">
<p>You can change various settings to improve your performance. This starts from setting the controls to changing the games config to your needs over to applying mods.</p>
<center><u>Config Hints:</u></center>
<p>You can find 'config.exe' in Soldat's installation folder, from where you can change various options and game settings.</p>
<p>Recommended settings:</p>
<li>Graphic &#8250; 'Resolution' &#61; Desktop</li>
<li>Graphic &#8250; 'FPS Limit' &#61; ON &#61;400</li>
<li>Performance &#8250; 'Render weather effects' &#61; OFF (disables the distractive rain, snow & sandstorm weather effects)</li>
<li>Performance &#8250; 'Render background scenery' &#61; OFF (turns off distractive background sceneries on maps)</li>

<p><center><u>Ingame Hints:</u></center></p>

<li>After starting Soldat.exe navigate to the 'Player' tab and turn on 'Force background' and select a color, which will now be the default background color for all maps. This may improve your focus on enemies and bullets and can also
make it less stressing for your eyes.</li>

<li>Increase game volume ingame by pressing 'SHIFT' and '+'.</li>
<li>Decrease game volume ingame by pressing 'SHIFT' and '-'.</li>
<li>Change secondary weapon faster by pressingt 'CTRL' and '1'-'4' (e.g. 'CTRL' and '3' will select the knife)</li>
<li>You can view your FPS and other information by pressing 'ALT' and 'F3'.</li>
<li>Press 'F8' to <a href="#demo">record a demo</a> or press 'F4' to take a screenshot.</li>
<li>Press 'TAB' to activate or deactivate the weapons menu.</li>

<p><center><u>Controls:</u></center></p>

<p>Soldat's default controls are really bad and far away from an ergonomic experience. That results in players struggling to execute certain actions simultaneously and slows down their movement.</p>
<p>You should make sure that the following actions can easily be accessed:</p>
<li>move left &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8212; recommended key: A (default)</li>
<li>move right &#8212; recommended key: D (default)</li>
<li>jump &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8212; recommended key: W (default)</li>
<li>lay down &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8212; recommended key: X or C</li>
<li>crouch &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8212; recommended key: S</li>
<li>grenade &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8212; recommended key: SPACE</li>
<li>throw flag &nbsp;&#8212; recommended key: CTRL-L</li>
<li>drop weapon / throw knife &#8212; recommended key: SHIFT</li>


<p>Choosing from the control keys above will certainly improve your time to react and execute actions.</p>
