<h2>RANKING SYSTEM</h2>
</div> <!-- /blue -->
<div class="content">
<h2>What are gather ranks?</h2>
<p>Anyone is welcome to join our gathers and enjoy competitive Soldat, regardless of gamemode background or skill level. However, in the interest of preserving balance within games, five special
 roles have been created to identify players who hold experience and who display proficiency in competitive play.</p>
<p>
<h2>Requirements for rank status</h2>
<i>Requirements are listed in the order of importance</i>

<ol>
<li><strong>Fully adhere to the rules</strong><br>
Your rank may be altered or removed if you are not applying to the rules.</li>

<li><strong>Show good level of CTF skill</strong><br>
Be a good/pro player but more important than that: have in depth CTF and map-knowledge and be a team contributor.</li>

<li><strong>Be active</strong><br>
Have a minimum of 150 played rounds.
In order to keep your current rank, you have to be active, stay on the channel and play at least sometimes<b>*</b> on our gather.</li>
</ol>
</p>
<b>*</b><i>sometimes - often</i>

<h2>LEVELS 1 - 3</h2>
</div> <!-- /blue -->
<div class="content">
<p>The Level 1 role denotes a player who has mastered the bare basics of 3v3 CTF gameplay and who is known to the community as an adequately competent player.
 To qualify for the Level 1 role, a player must either (a) have cumulatively at least 3 months of 3v3 CTF experience.
 The Level 1 role has no particular expectation of activity, thus wholly inactive or infrequently active players may be assigned this role. The Level 2 role is simply an "elevated" version of the Level 1 role intended for more advanced players.
 Level 3 will be assigned to experienced CTF gather players.
</p> 
</div>

<div class="blue">
<h2>LEVELS 4 & 5 (VOICED)</h2>
</div> <!-- /blue -->
<div class="content">
<p>Players assigned the Level 4 and Level 5 roles have the option to '!add+". The Level 4 role denotes an active, well-regarded player who excels in 3v3 CTF gameplay and who is capable of consistently competing at
 levels of high skill; the role may sometimes be referred  to as "voice" or "+" (alluding to its IRC equivalent). To qualify for the Level 4 role, the admins must determine that a player demonstrates (1) activity,
 (2) approval from the community, and (3) a level of skill which would not cause a disproportionate level of imbalance in gather+ games.
 All three aspects are necessary to be assigned the Level 4 role. The Level 5 role is simply an "elevated" version of the Level 4 intended for top players.</p>

<!--
<p>After two voice systems which proved to be ineffective, we decided to create a completely new one.
Stats will only be used as a guideline, since some people are known to gain an advantage through dishonest means.</p>

<p>We're making changes because of two reasons.
Firstly, we would like to improve the activity of gather+.
The second reason is we want to provide a high quality gather for our gather+ players.</p>

<h2>Big voice removal</h2>

<p>It might sound ironic; how could decreasing the amount of players eventually increase overall activity?
No worries! In order to make something great, you need to cut off the mediocre pieces.
Activity will rise if something is better, right?
And don't forget that fresh, good new players will receive voice to fill the gap of the ones removed.</p>

<p>In addition to our usual requirements for voice we now also have a voting system, where already voiced players can give their input.
This is done by voting from the gather channel. The bot will determine if you are voiced, and then register your vote.
This voting system will be used as a guideline; admins always have the final say in who gets (de)voiced.</p>

<h2>How to vote</h2>
<ol>
<li>Make sure you are voiced in the gather channel (#Gather.EU).</li>

<li>Find the name of a player with an open vote, or ask an admin to open one.
A list of currently active votes can be found at the <a href="<?php echo $_SERVER['PHP_SELF']; ?>?p=voice">voice page</a>.</li>

<li>Use the command <strong>!vote <i>name</i></strong>, where <i>name</i> is who you are voting for.</li>

<li>The bot will send you a channel notice giving you the status of your vote.</li>
</ol>

<p>Your rank may be altered or removed by admins at any given time. Make sure to apply to the requirements above and to never break rules.</p>

<div class="content">
<h2>We will either voice you whenever we feel like you match the requirements above but if that does not happen you can query <a href="http://dardar.gather.vet">darDar</a> on IRC to add you to the 'voting list'.</h2>
<p>Additionally to the gather admins we have found a voice team, which votes on voicing or devoicing players.</p>
