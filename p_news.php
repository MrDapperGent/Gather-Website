		<td><p><b>#Soldat Gather - Goodbye IRC [now on Discord]</b></p>
		#Soldat Gather (#Gather.EU) has been the most active gather for the past 7 years. However, it is time to say goodbye to IRC and move forward after nearly a decade on the #Soldat channel on IRC QuakeNet. Thanks to anyone who played there and we're hoping to see you again on Discord.
		We found a new home on Discord and there's already a working gatherbot. Join our gather on Discord by clicking <a href="http://gather.soldat.pl/discord" target="_blank">here</a>. Credits go to XvayS & themangokid. <a href="https://forums.soldat.pl/index.php?topic=44979.0" target="_blank">[read more]</a>
